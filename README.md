# ML-MCU: Machine Learning - Microcontroller
We provide ML-MCU, a framework with our novel Opt-SGD and Opt-OVO algorithms, to enable both binary and multi-class ML classifier training directly on MCUs. Thus, ML-MCU enables billions of MCU-based IoT edge devices to self learn/train (offline) after their deployment, using live data from a wide range of IoT use-cases.

Before using the implementation of our algorithms for onboard training, we recommend users to use better resource boards like ESP32 and Adafruit Feather nrf52, then move on to using the tiny ones like Arduino Nano, Uno, etc.
