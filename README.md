# ML-MCU: Machine Learning - Microcontroller
We provide ML-MCU, a framework with our novel Opt-SGD and Opt-OVO algorithms, to enable both binary and multi-class ML classifier training directly on MCUs. Thus, ML-MCU enables billions of MCU-based IoT edge devices to self learn/train (offline) after their deployment, using live data from a wide range of IoT use-cases.
